For example, if the string "Zebra-493?" is rotated 3 places, the resulting string is "Cheud-726?". 
Every alphabetic character is replaced with the character 3 letters higher (wrapping around from Z to A), 
and every numeric character replaced with the character 3 digits higher (wrapping around from 9 to 0). 
Note that the non-alphanumeric characters remain unchanged.

valid_symbols = "All-convoYs-9-be:Alert1."

x = "" 
rotationFactor = 4
for i in valid_symbols:
    if i.islower():
        n = (ord(i) + rotationFactor - 97)%(26) + 97
        x+=chr(n)
        
    elif i.isupper():
        n = (ord(i) + rotationFactor - 65)%(26) + 65
        x+=chr(n)
        
    elif i.isdigit():
        n = (int(i) + rotationFactor)%(10) 
        x+= str(n)

      x+= i
